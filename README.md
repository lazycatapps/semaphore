# Semaphore for Lazycat Platform

## Project Overview

This repository bundles the official [Semaphore](https://github.com/semaphoreui/semaphore) deployment snippets so they can be launched quickly on the Lazycat platform. It packages the upstream Docker Compose configuration together with a helper script and environment defaults, making it simple to provision Semaphore alongside its PostgreSQL backend.

## Key Features

- Containerized setup that mirrors the upstream Semaphore deployment patterns
- Prewired PostgreSQL configuration with persistent volumes and sensible defaults
- Optional remote runner stack enabled through an additional Compose layer
- Helper script that selects the correct Docker platform flags for Lazycat environments
- Environment template (`.env`) that exposes the most important tuning switches

## Acknowledgements

- **Semaphore maintainers** for creating and maintaining the open-source automation platform
- **Open-source contributors** who continue to improve Semaphore and its ecosystem
- **Lazycat platform team** for providing the infrastructure to distribute packaged applications
